A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

Identify Root Causes:
Postmortems aim to determine the underlying reasons behind a software incident, outage, or failure. This involves thorough investigation and analysis to identify the root causes that contributed to the issue. By understanding the root causes, teams can address the core problems rather than just the symptoms, preventing similar incidents in the future.

Continuous Improvement:
Postmortems serve as a mechanism for continuous improvement. They provide a structured framework for teams to reflect on what went wrong, why it happened, and how it can be prevented in the future. Through discussions, recommendations, and action items, teams can implement corrective measures, update processes, enhance monitoring, and refine procedures to enhance system resilience and reliability.

In summary, postmortems help teams gain insights into the causes of software incidents and guide them toward making informed decisions for preventing similar issues and improving overall software development and operations processes.

Duration: July 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - July 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in error rates.
10:10 AM: Investigation initiated by the DevOps team to identify the root cause.
10:20 AM: Initial assumption: High database load causing connection timeouts. Database servers were checked and optimized.
10:30 AM: Misleading path: Scaling up database clusters to handle the load, but no improvement in error rates.
11:00 AM: Incident escalated to the Backend Engineering team for deeper analysis.
11:15 AM: Root cause identified: DNS misconfiguration leading to service degradation.
11:25 AM: DNS configuration fixed, services restarted, and issue resolved.
11:30 AM: Services fully restored and monitoring verified stability.


Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was identified as a DNS misconfiguration in the service infrastructure. The misconfigured DNS settings led to intermittent connection failures between services, causing the API service to become unresponsive.

To resolve the issue, the Backend Engineering team corrected the DNS configuration settings, ensuring proper communication between the services. The services were restarted to apply the changes, and the API service was restored to normal operation.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

DNS Configuration Review: Perform regular audits of DNS configurations to ensure accuracy and consistency across services.

Automated Monitoring: Implement automated monitoring for DNS health and service connectivity to quickly detect and respond to potential issues.

Redundant DNS Servers: Set up redundant DNS servers to minimize the impact of misconfigurations or failures.

Incident Escalation Protocol: Enhance the incident escalation process to involve the Backend Engineering team sooner for complex issues.
