0. My first postmortem

Duration: July 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - July 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: API Service Outage - Users experienced intermittent connection failures and delays. Approximately 20% of users were affected.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in error rates.
10:10 AM: Investigation initiated by the DevOps team to identify the root cause.
10:20 AM: Initial assumption: High database load causing connection timeouts. Database servers were checked and optimized.
10:30 AM: Misleading path: Scaling up database clusters to handle the load, but no improvement in error rates.
11:00 AM: Incident escalated to the Backend Engineering team for deeper analysis.
11:15 AM: Root cause identified: DNS misconfiguration leading to service degradation.
11:25 AM: DNS configuration fixed, services restarted, and issue resolved.
11:30 AM: Services fully restored and monitoring verified stability.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was identified as a DNS misconfiguration in the service infrastructure. The misconfigured DNS settings led to intermittent connection failures between services, causing the API service to become unresponsive.

To resolve the issue, the Backend Engineering team corrected the DNS configuration settings, ensuring proper communication between the services. The services were restarted to apply the changes, and the API service was restored to normal operation.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

DNS Configuration Review: Perform regular audits of DNS configurations to ensure accuracy and consistency across services.

Automated Monitoring: Implement automated monitoring for DNS health and service connectivity to quickly detect and respond to potential issues.

Redundant DNS Servers: Set up redundant DNS servers to minimize the impact of misconfigurations or failures.

Incident Escalation Protocol: Enhance the incident escalation process to involve the Backend Engineering team sooner for complex issues.
