The ALX Project: API advanced
The goal of this project is to get more familiar with complex API interactions, including handling pagination, authentication, and advanced querying techniques. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. In this project, advanced API concepts would be discussed. A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

Project Requirements:computer_mouse::computer:
All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

All codes should use the PEP 8 style
All files must be executable
The length of all files will be tested using wc
All modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)')
You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
All comments, feedbacks and suggestions are highly welcome. Kindly take a look at my codes to get an insight. Scroll up ⬆️, please.
