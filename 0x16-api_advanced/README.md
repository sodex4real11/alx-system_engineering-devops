The ALX Project: API advanced
The goal of this project is to get more familiar with complex API interactions, including handling pagination, authentication, and advanced querying techniques. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. In this project, advanced API concepts would be discussed. A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.
